Patience
========

While consumers are spending less time on the phone overall, patients are phoning their doctors more than ever. Doctors' offices are struggling to man the phones, handling everything from appointment and prescription refill requests, to concerns from sick patients, billing issues, and lately, about how the Affordable Care Act will affect them. However, insurance carriers don't compensate doctors for any of those phone calls and there hasn't been a suitable solution to triaging these requests. Thus, more offices and hospitals are looking for ways to field fewer patients' calls. On the other hand, patients are becoming increasingly frustrated by long wait times on the phone and their requests often disappearing into the ether. Enter Patient.ly.

 Patient.ly is a CRM iPhone application for doctors to manage their patients' requests/concerns. With the magic of the Twilio API, a patient can send a text message to their doctor's designated Twilio number, which automatically spawns a new task in the system and alerts the doctor in real-time.  Once the task is created, it's securely stored (bye-bye Post-it notes), triaged, and addressed by the doctor. Such a system will expedite care, allow for accountability, and help doctors track their services. A win-win situation for both the patient and doctor.
